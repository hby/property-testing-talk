# Propert-based Testing Outline

I gave a short talk on property-based testing in Clojure at [HuntFunc](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/huntfunc) on May 5, 2015. This is the project I demoed code from. The basic outline is below. It was quite informal.

## Origin
- QuickCheck (Haskell)
- Propert-based Testing
- Generative Testing

## Approach
- Generate random values
- Use as input
- Define properties
- Run tests

## Complimentary to other testing approaches

## Learn to think in properties
- Roundtrip
- Trusted implementation
- Input/Output Relationships
